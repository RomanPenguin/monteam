SUMMARY:PROTEST TO MAKE KFC 24 HOUR
LOCATION:KFC
URL:https://www.facebook.com/events/362072134699575/
DESCRIPTION:For far too long Aussies have been
  deprived of delicious\, golden fri
 ed chicken at 3am in the morning. 
 Unfortunately most KFC stores in A
 ustralia close well before the mid
 night munchies kick in\, forcing ma
 ny of us to go home empty handed a
 nd hungry. KFC can help fix this p
 roblem by putting 24/7 Drive-Thru'
 s into place. With your help\, we c
 an end this problem and bring peac
 e to our stomachs. \n\nhttps://www.f
